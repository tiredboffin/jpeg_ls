DESCRIPTION
===========

The image compression programs in this package are implementations
of the JPEG-LS standard as described in the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 1
(ITU-T SG8) document.

PEG-LS Tutorial
===============

If you are new to the JPEG-LS coding standard, the core of the standard 
is based on this paper:

 M. Weinberger, G. Seroussi, G. Sapiro, " LOCO-I: A Low Complexity, Context-Based,
 Lossless Image Compression Algorithm, " Proc. IEEE Data Compression Conference,
 Snowbird, Utah, March-April 1996. 

COMPILATION
===========

For the Encoder do the Following at the UNIX prompt:
cd Encoder
make jpelse

For the Decoder do the Following at the UNIX prompt:
cd Decoder
make jpelsd

USAGE
=====

When in doubt about the command-line options and parameters, run
program with the option '-u' after the program name.

The original images should be in raster format, but WITHOUT the header
(also called RAW format). It is assumed that the image is stored as a
sequence of horizontal lines.

For monochrome images each pixel can be represented with 1 or 2 bytes
(most significant first).

EXAMPLES
========

(1) Here is an example of the usage of the program 'jpeglse'.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

<UNIX prompt> jpeglse image1 output nrows ncols P

        image1 - Original image
        output - compressed bit stream
        nrows  - # of image lines
        ncols  - # of pel/line
        P      - Precision  bits/pel.


(2) Here is an example of the usage of the program 'jpeglsd'
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
<UNIX prompt> image1 output

        image1 - compressed
        output - reconstructed image
