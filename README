The programs implement lossless compression and decompression of monochrome still
images stored in headerless format, 1 or 2 bytes per pel.
The *.z files have been compressed with 'gzip' and must be decompressed with
'gunzip'.  The archive files with .tar extensions (after decompression) are
exploded with 'tar xvf'.
